# L-System Studio

**L-System Studio** is an interactive tool for creating and visualizing **L-Systems**, a mathematical system for generating repeating patterns such as plants, trees, and geometric designs.  

The project is intended for **free public use** – everyone is welcome to use part of the code or the entire project, provided the source is credited.

## How it works
L-Systems are based on **recursive rules** that define how a string develops in each generation. The project uses the `examples.json` file for ready-made examples, and HTML + JavaScript for real-time visualization and animation. You can modify the rules and parameters and see the changes instantly.

### Key Features
- Create custom L-Systems.
- Real-time animation of plants and patterns.
- Load pre-made examples (`examples.json`).
- Clean and easy-to-use interface (`index.html` and `animation.html`).

   * The project is available at [L-System Studio](https://hananel42.github.io/L-system-studio/)
